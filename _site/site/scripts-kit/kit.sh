# the arguments (the Worker writes them into it). Not `sudo -E`, which many sudoers refuse, and sudo's env_reset drops
# everything else, so `sudo env` hands over by name the settings that are set: the kit's own and the script's [names]
# (consent like INSTALL_DOCKER=1, which a headless fix tells the person to set). Tokens are not among them: a command
# line is what ps and sudo's log show, so a token the person exported is asked for again on the terminal.
# INTENTIC_ELEVATED=1 marks the copy sudo runs; a copy that is still not root stops instead of asking sudo again.
